This repository will keep upgrading throughout the semester and onwards, as the project is getting developed. The project will aim to be a calendar management app.

As of March 22, 2025, I, Yoko, have been using Replit for programming codes for Node.js (with Express.js) and React.js, bringing the project to be full stack development. I have been assigned to work on classes of Rank, Website, and UI.
